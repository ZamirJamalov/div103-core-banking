# Core Banking System (PL/SQL Implementation)

## Project Overview

This repository houses a Core Banking System (CBS) being developed purely in PL/SQL, utilizing the advanced capabilities of Oracle Database. Our objective is to construct a system that exemplifies the power of PL/SQL for financial operations and transactions. This CBS aims to showcase a prototype for handling key banking features including account management, transaction processing, ledger balancing, and customer profiling.

## Features

The system is currently under development and the following features are intended:

- **Account Management**: Creating and managing customer accounts with features such as account opening, closing, and maintenance.
- **Transaction Processing**: Facilitating banking transactions including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers with complete PL/SQL procedures and functions.
- **Customer Relationship Management**: A module to manage customer data, provide service support, and integrate with banking services.

## Progress

As the system is being built from the ground up, we are currently in the initial phases, focusing on:

- Establishing a robust database schema suitable for banking operations.
- Developing a set of PL/SQL packages to encapsulate core business logic.
- Ensuring transactional integrity and security as per industry standards.

## Collaboration

We welcome collaboration from financial experts, database administrators, and PL/SQL developers. Insights into banking processes, regulatory compliance, or PL/SQL optimization are especially valuable at this stage. If you're interested in contributing, please feel free to reach out or submit pull requests.

## Vision

Our vision is to demonstrate the versatility of PL/SQL in developing a core banking system that is secure, reliable, and efficient. By building this system, we aim to explore the full potential of Oracle Database in financial domains and pave the way for innovative banking solutions.

Stay tuned for updates as we make progress in this exciting venture.
